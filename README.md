# FaceHarmony App

## Overview

The FaceHarmony App is an AI-powered profile picture generator app that allows users to create stunning, professional-quality images of themselves without needing a photographer. The app uses artificial intelligence to generate photos in various settings, styles, and poses while maintaining the user's natural look.

**Important:** FaceHarmony is NOT an image transformation app. Unlike many other AI photo applications, FaceHarmony doesn't transform or edit your existing photos. Instead, it learns from your uploaded images to create a personalized AI model, then generates completely new professional photos based on what it has learned about your appearance.


## What Sets FaceHarmony Apart

- **Unlimited Selection Potential**: Get a fresh batch of 40 new AI-generated photos every day
- **Pay Only For What You Love**: Unlike competitors, reject unlimited photos without penalty
- **Gamified Experience**: Swipe left to reject, swipe right to download a photo
- **No Subscription Model**: Simple token-based system - purchase tokens to create models and download photos
- **True AI Generation**: Unlike image transformation apps, FaceHarmony creates entirely new photos using advanced generative AI

## How the Token System Works

FaceHarmony uses two types of tokens to give you complete control over your AI photo experience:

### Model Tokens
- Each model token allows you to create one AI model for a single person
- You can create models for yourself, family members, or loved ones
- Creating a model requires uploading 12+ photos of the person
- The model learns the person's facial features and characteristics
- Once created, a model can generate an unlimited number of preview photos

### Photo Tokens
- Photo tokens are used to download the AI-generated photos you love
- After your model is created, you'll see preview images in various styles
- Swipe right on a photo you like and spend one photo token to download it
- Each downloaded photo costs one photo token
- You only pay for the images you want to keep

### Free vs. Instant Generation
- **Daily Photo Refreshes**: The system automatically generates a fresh batch of 40 new photos each day based on your preferences
  - Each day brings new creative options to explore
  - Continuous use means unlimited photo options over time
  - You can download any of these photos using a photo token if you like them
- **Priority Generation**: Need a specific style immediately?
  - Pre-pay with a photo token to place an instant order
  - Your order is prioritized and generated right away
  - Note: When pre-paying, the photo token is spent regardless of whether you download the resulting photo
  - This option is ideal when you need a specific style without waiting

This two-token system ensures you have flexibility to create multiple AI models and only download the photos you truly love, without paying for unwanted images.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many photos do I need to upload?
You need to upload a minimum of 12 photos to create your AI model. We recommend uploading 15-20 high-quality images for the best results.

### What types of photos should I upload?
Upload a variety of high-quality photos that show your face clearly. Include medium shots, medium close-ups, and a few full-body shots. Aim for diverse backgrounds, varied clothing, and natural expressions. Avoid extreme close-ups or very wide shots.

### How important is photo diversity?
Diversity is crucial for creating a high-quality AI model. Include photos with different backgrounds (both indoor and outdoor), varied clothing, and different lighting conditions. This helps the AI understand your appearance in various contexts.

### Can I include photos with accessories like hats or sunglasses?
Yes, but limit these to 1-2 photos. If you often wear accessories, include a couple of images with your favorite items. Avoid having both hats and sunglasses in the same photo, and don't overdo it with accessories in general.

### Should I avoid repetitive elements in my photos?
Yes, try to avoid repetitive elements. Ensure that no particular item (e.g., a specific piece of furniture, wall, or background element) appears more than once in different photos. This helps the AI focus on you rather than recurring objects.

### What are the best poses or expressions for the photos?
Aim for natural expressions and poses. Avoid exaggerated faces or extreme side views. A mix of casual poses and slight variations in facial expressions works best.

### Is there a specific resolution requirement for the photos?
While we don't specify an exact resolution, aim for high-quality images. Each photo should be at least 350x350 pixels, but higher resolutions are better. Avoid low-quality, blurry, or pixelated images.

### Can I upload group photos or images with multiple people?
While you can crop group photos to show just your face during the verification process, we strongly recommend using solo photos from the start for best results.

### Is it okay to use similar photos?
While it's not strictly forbidden, using very similar photos can reduce the quality of your AI model. Try to provide a diverse set of images for the best results.

### Can I upload photos of pets or other subjects?
Currently, our AI model is designed for human faces only. Please don't upload photos of pets, animals, or non-human subjects.

### How recent should my photos be?
For the most accurate results, use recent photos that reflect your current appearance.

### Any tips for selecting the best photos?
Choose clear, well-lit photos where your face is easily visible. Include a mix of indoor and outdoor shots, different outfits, and various expressions. Avoid heavily edited or filtered images, as natural photos work best for training the AI.

### How similar are the generated photos to my actual self?
The generated images feature facial characteristics similar to yours but are reimagined versions of you in new scenes or situations. For example, if you generate a folk-style image with East Asian cultural elements, many of your facial features will be adapted to that cultural context. A small number of the photos, particularly in everyday styles, may look very similar to you. If you prefer images that strictly maintain your exact appearance without any reinterpretation, there are other AI applications available that may better suit your needs.

### Can I use the generated photos for commercial purposes?
Yes, you can use generated photos of yourself without any restrictions.

### How can I provide feedback or suggest new features for FaceHarmony?
A page is provided within the app where you can submit your feedback or ask for our help.
